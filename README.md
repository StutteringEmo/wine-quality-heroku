# üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction

This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict **wine quality** (0‚Äì10) using the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from UCI.  
The model is trained with **Linear Regression**, containerized with **Docker**, and deployed to **Heroku**.  

The project demonstrates the full workflow of:

1. Training a model and saving it with scikit-learn
2. Creating a Flask API and a web form UI for predictions
3. Containerizing the app using Docker
4. Deploying it to the cloud with Heroku

## üìÇ Repository Structure
- `Assignment#5_ANA680.ipynb` ‚Üí Jupyter Notebook (EDA, training, evaluation)  
- `wine_quality_model.pkl` ‚Üí Trained scikit-learn model (serialized with pickle)
- `app.py` ‚Üí Flask app that serves predictions via:
  - `/predict` (API endpoint for JSON input)
  - Web form UI for manual input
- `requirements.txt` ‚Üí Python dependencies
- `Dockerfile` ‚Üí Instructions for building the Docker container
- `Procfile` ‚Üí Tells Heroku how to run the app

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Download the code from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/StutteringEmo/wine-quality-ml.git
cd wine-quality-ml
```

### 2. Local Python Run
If you just want to run it locally with Python (no Docker):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
‚û° Open your browser at: http://127.0.0.1:5000
- You‚Äôll see a simple web form where you can input wine parameters.
- Predictions will be displayed on the page.
- The API can also be called programmatically at /predict with JSON input.

---

## Run with Docker
Docker allows you to package everything (code + dependencies) so it runs the same anywhere.

### Build the image
```bash
docker build -t wine-quality-app .
```

### Run the container
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 wine-quality-app
```
‚û° App available at: http://127.0.0.1:5000

---

## Deployment on Heroku
Heroku lets you deploy the containerized app to the cloud.

Steps performed:

1. Created a new Heroku app (wine-quality)
2. Set the stack to container:
```bash
heroku stack:set container -a wine-quality
```

3. Built and pushed the Docker image to Heroku registry:
```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t registry.heroku.com/wine-quality/web --push .
```

4. Released the container:
```bash
heroku container:release web -a wine-quality
```

## Wine Quality Prediction App

This project is a Machine Learning model deployment using Flask + Docker + Heroku.
It predicts wine quality based on physicochemical properties.

### Features
- Flask API for predictions (/predict)
- Simple web form UI for manual input
- Dockerized for portability
- Deployed on Heroku

### Example Input (Web Form)
